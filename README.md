Task Manager ASP.NET Core MVC Application
This repository showcases my Task Manager application, built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It features:

Entity Framework for seamless data access.
A SQL Server database for efficient storage of task information, including titles and descriptions.
User authentication through ASP.NET Identity to ensure secure access.
A responsive user interface designed with Bootstrap, offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks.
Implementation of best practices for error handling and validation, ensuring data integrity and a smooth user experience.
Version control managed with Git for efficient project collaboration and updates.
Explore the code to see how I applied modern development practices to create a robust task management solution.
